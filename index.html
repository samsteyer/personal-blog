                        While the battle between electric vehicles and hydrogen-powered cars is
                        often assumed to be off in the future, the superior speed, lower cost,
                        and far greater availability of charging infrastructure suggests EVs
                        have already won.

                        Many of the companies that have accomplished 100% renewable energy
                        have done so by funding offsite projects that generate as much energy
                        as they use, but deliver it somewhere else. Does this accomplish...
